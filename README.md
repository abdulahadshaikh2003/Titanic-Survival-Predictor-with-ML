# Titanic Survival Predictor with Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features like age, sex, class, and more.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and feature encoding.
- **Machine Learning Model**: RandomForestClassifier to predict passenger survival.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy and classification report to assess model performance.
